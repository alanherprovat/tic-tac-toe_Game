I developed a web application utilizing React JS, which encompasses features of tic-tac-toe. The screenshot below provides a visual representation of the web applicationâ€™s interface.

## Functionalities:
   - Crafted a dynamic interface that presents a live tic-tac-toe gaming experience.
   - The game is designed for two players.
   - The game includes three possible outcomes: a win for player X, a win for player O, or a draw.
   - Implemented a reset feature that allows the game to be restarted once any of the outcomes is reached.

   - After completing Production build, project is being deployed at [Netlify](https://tie-tac-toe-demo.netlify.app/).

## How to Clone the Project
Here is a step-by-step guide on how to clone a project from GitHub:

1. **Find the Repository**: Log in to your GitHub account and find the repository you want to clone.
2. **Copy the URL**: On the master/main page of the repository, click on the `Code` button. You will see an option to clone. Copy the URL.
3. **Open Terminal**: Depending on your system, you'll use Terminal (with Mac) or Command line (with Windows git bash) to move it to your local directory.
4. **Change Directory**: Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
5. **Clone the Repository**: Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. Press Enter to create your local clone. The command will look something like this:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/alanherprovat/tic-tac-toe_Game.git
    ```
6. **Check the Directory**: You should see a folder that just being clonned to your local directory.
7. Open the project folder in VS Code, launch a terminal, and enter `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
